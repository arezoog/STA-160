STA 160 Capstone Project 

This project constructs a historical price index for California’s Resource Adequacy (RA) capacity market using Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Electric Quarterly Report data and develops predictive tools to support procurement decisions in a bilateral, non-transparent market. After extracting and extensively cleaning nationwide transaction data, including correcting unit inconsistencies, removing invalid prices, filtering non-monthly trades, and trimming extreme outliers, a consolidated dataset of standardized RA capacity transactions for 2019–2025 was generated. Exploratory analysis revealed strong right-skewness and data-quality irregularities that required iterative preprocessing to ensure reliability. Using this cleaned dataset, both static and interactive visualizations showing weighted average prices and traded quantities across delivery months were produced. Forecasting models, including SARIMAX, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest, were developed to predict short-term capacity price movements. The models captured broad temporal trends with moderate out-of-sample accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of forward-looking price estimation despite market opacity. Finally, we deployed an interactive dashboard using Dash and Render to allow users to explore historical trends and model outputs. Together, these methods provide a foundational tool for understanding and forecasting RA capacity prices in California’s bilateral market.
